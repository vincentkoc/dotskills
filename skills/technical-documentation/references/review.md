# Review Docs Playbook

Read `principles.md` first, then apply this checklist.

## 1. Scope and classification

- Identify doc type and target audience.
- Confirm brownfield vs evergreen intent.
- Confirm expected outcome for the reader.

## 2. Structural review

- Funnel check: what/why, quickstart, next steps.
- Validate heading flow and navigation discoverability.
- Flag critical content trapped in images or buried sections.
- Check Diataxis alignment and split mixed-purpose sections.

## 3. Writing quality review

- Check for concise, scannable paragraphs.
- Remove ambiguous pronouns and undefined terms.
- Verify examples are executable and scoped correctly.
- Verify tone is directive, technical, and non-hand-wavy.

## 4. Brownfield review mode

- Verify compatibility with existing docs IA and conventions.
- Verify anchors, redirects, and cross-doc links remain valid.
- Flag regressions in onboarding and task completion paths.
- Ensure changed terminology is intentionally propagated.

## 5. Evergreen review mode

- Flag date-stamped or brittle wording without version scope.
- Check ownership and refresh signals are present.
- Ensure recommendations remain valid after routine product evolution.
- Flag missing deprecation/migration guidance.

## 6. Tooling and platform review

Read `tooling.md` if platform fit is uncertain.

- Check whether content uses platform primitives effectively.
- Flag structure that fights the chosen docs platform.
- Recommend targeted platform-aware improvements.

## 7. Output format

1. Blocking issues (file + required fix)
2. Non-blocking improvements
3. Validation notes (done vs pending)
