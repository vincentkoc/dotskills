# Build Docs Playbook

## 1. Define intent

- Audience, prerequisites, and job-to-be-done.
- Expected reader outcome immediately after completion.
- Doc type: tutorial, how-to, reference, explanation.

## 2. Structure first

- Use clear headings and a scannable flow.
- Put key takeaway first in each section.
- Include next-step links.

## 3. Brownfield build mode

- Match existing terminology, navigation, and component patterns.
- Avoid breaking established information architecture.
- Document migration deltas when replacing old content.

## 4. Evergreen build mode

- Prefer stable concepts over ephemeral release details.
- Isolate version-sensitive details behind explicit sections.
- Add maintenance markers: assumptions, dependencies, refresh triggers.

## 5. Quality bar

- Commands/snippets should be copy-ready.
- Include common failure paths and safe defaults.
- Keep language precise and low-ambiguity.
